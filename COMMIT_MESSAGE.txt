feat: Initial implementation of Winter Square core infrastructure

Add ultra-low latency market data processing framework with lock-free
architecture targeting sub-200ns end-to-end latency.

Core Components:
- CoreEngine: Main orchestrator for network, parsing, and distribution
- UDPReceiver: High-performance UDP multicast receiver with ring buffer
- Dispatcher: Lock-free message distribution to multiple subscribers
- SPSCQueue/MPSCQueue: Cache-line aligned lock-free queues
- IParser/ISubscriber: Pluggable interfaces for protocol/handler extension

Key Features:
- Header-only C++20 library (hft::core namespace)
- Zero-copy MessageView for hot path optimization
- 64-byte cache-line alignment to prevent false sharing
- CPU affinity support for deterministic latency
- Configurable network, parser, and dispatcher threads

Build System:
- CMake 3.16+ with Release/Debug configurations
- build.sh script with --debug, --clean, --test flags
- Separate targets for examples, benchmarks, and tests

Examples:
- basic_example: UDP receiver with PrintSubscriber
- udp_sender: Test packet generator with rate control

Tests:
- Comprehensive lock-free queue tests (SPSC/MPSC)
- Basic ops, capacity, FIFO ordering, thread safety, move semantics
